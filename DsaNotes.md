### data structures and algorithms

## What is data structures and algorithms ?

Data structures and algorithms are a fundamental part of computer science. Data structures are a way of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified in an efficient manner. Algorithms are a set of instructions that take an input, process it and produce an output. They are used to solve problems and are the basis of computer programming.

## what is bubble sort?

Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through a list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It is one of the simplest sorting algorithms and is often used to sort small lists of numbers. Bubble sort has a worst-case and average complexity of O(n2), where n is the number of items being sorted.

## what is selection sort?

Selection sort is an in-place sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the list and moving it to the beginning of the list. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.
Selection Sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) and a space complexity of O(1).

## what is merge sort?

Merge sort is a divide and conquer sorting algorithm that works by recursively breaking down a larger list of items into smaller, more manageable lists and then combining them in a way that creates a sorted list. The time complexity of Merge Sort is O(n log n) in all 3 cases (worst, average and best) as merge sort always divides the array into two halves and takes linear time to merge two halves. The space complexity of Merge Sort is O(n) which makes it relatively space efficient.

## what is quick sort ?

Quick Sort is a sorting algorithm that sorts an array of elements by dividing it into two subarrays, the first subarray containing elements that are less than or equal to a pivot element, and the second subarray containing elements that are greater than the pivot element. The algorithm then recursively sorts each subarray until the entire array is sorted. Quick Sort is typically faster than Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort, and is often used in practice.

Time Complexity: O(nlog(n))
Space Complexity: O(log(n))
