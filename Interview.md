 <!-- There are many to reason to live, But let me tell you bit about why you must not quite, Nor You came in the world through your wish neither you are allowed to leave the world by your wish,
Life here in the world is a kind of Entrance Exam, For an endless Life based on Our Deeds We will be given Heaven ( स्वर्ग ) or hell ( नरक )
Harming our own self come under an Unforgettable sin, We must keep in mind..
( I'm saying it as big sin coz mohmmad saw says whoever commit suicide, he'll be in the hell  though I am sure in Vedas it will be also sin )
If I've said anything on what you don't agree or like I apologise...
Have patience, Everything will be Fine  -->
