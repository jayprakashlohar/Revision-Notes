##What are keys in React?

*A “key” is a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements in React. Keys are used in React to identify which items in the list are changed, updated, or deleted. In other words, we can say that keys are used to give an identity to the elements in the lists*

##What is memoisation in react?

*Memoization is an optimization technique for accelerating computer programs by caching the results of heavy function calls and returning them when similar inputs are encountered repeatedly. Simply, React memoization is similar to caching.*

##What is the difference between react.memo and react.useMemo?

*The major difference between React.
React. memo is a higher-order component to memoize an entire functional component. useMemo is a react hook to memoize a function within a functional component*

##How does Routing work with react?

*React Router is a standard library for routing in React. It enables the navigation among views of various components in a React Application, allows changing the browser URL, and keeps the UI in sync with the URL.
Let us create a simple application to React to understand how the React Router works. The application will contain three components: home component, about a component, and contact component. We will use React Router to navigate between these components.*

##What is SSR and CSR?

*The main difference between CSR and SSR is where the page is rendered. SSR renders the page on the server-side and CSR renders the page on the client-side. The client-side dynamically manages the routing without refreshing the page each time the client requests another route.*

##What is useCallback?

*useCallback is a hook that will return a memoized version of the callback function that only changes if one of the dependencies has changed. Memoization is a way to cache a result so that it doesn't need to be computed again. This can boost performance*

##What are callback refs?

*The function receives the React component instance or HTML DOM element as its argument, which can be stored and accessed elsewhere.*

##How does Context API work? What does it solve?

*The Context API helps share data between components which you can't easily share with props, for example, complex data objects. React Context API provides a way to send data like userid, auth, and theme data through the component tree without sending any props manually at every level.*
